#### Purpose of Use of Linux

Linux can be used for many purposes due to its nature. Linux is free and open source software.

Free software means software that respects the freedom of users and the community. Open source means that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, review, modify, and improve a software. So free software is not a question of price, it's a matter of freedom.


When you want to use Linux, you can install and use it without any license fee. Linux has a flexible structure. If you are wondering how the operating system works, you can examine this issue in depth with Linux. The open-source code of Linux allows you to work on it more comfortably.

#### Uses of Linux 

Linux has the potential for being widely used. In the structure of Linux, it has the ability to work with processors with very high processing power, as well as limited processing power. Therefore, the usage areas of Linux vary widely. It is widely used in server systems, personal computers, devices hosting embedded systems, smart devices, and mobile devices.


#### Benefits of Linux

Linux is a user-friendly operating system that provides many benefits to its users. This training explains the importance of Linux from the cyber security perspective.

Linux is famous for its command line. The power of the command line is an opportunity for cybersecurity professionals working in the cybersecurity industry because the use of Linux's command line can make many things easier and provide flexibility in application practice in cyber security projects and operations. It can save time. SOC analysts usually work on high dimensional data and Linux can easily handle the use of high dimensional data with the command line. So, it may always be beneficial for SOC analysts to have a Linux operating system at hand.


#### Common Linux distributions

There are many different versions of Linux suitable for every type of user. Each of these versions is called a distribution, or simply a distro. The most popular and frequently used Linux distributions are as follows:

- Ubuntu
- centos
- defora
- debian
- red hat 
- linux mint
- open suse
- manjaro 


There are a number of Linux distributions and the new ones keep being published day by day. In order to see and examine the Linux distributions, you can refer to the distrowatch.com web address.
