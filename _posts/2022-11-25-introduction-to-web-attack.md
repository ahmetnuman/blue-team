## Introduction

We have prepared the Web Attacks 101 training to provide a better understanding of cyber attacks (of which 75% are web based applications) and how to respond to these attacks.

#### What are Web Attacks?

Web applications are applications that provide services for users through a browser interface. Today web applications make up a large portion of internet usage. Sites such as Google, Facebook and YouTube (excluding the mobile applications) are actually web applications.

Because web applications are an interface on the internet for many organizations, attackers could exploit these applications and infiltrate into devices, they could capture personal data or cause service breakdowns inflicting a serious amount of financial damage. 

A study by Acunetix determined that 75 % of all cyber attacks performed were at the web application level.

Below you will find some attack methods used to infiltrate web applications. We will address these methods in our “Web Attacks 101” course; we will explain what these methods are, how and why attackers use them and how we can detect such activities.

- SQL Injection
- Cross Site Scripting
- Command Injection
- IDOR
- RFI & LFI
- File Upload (Web Shell)

#### What skill will you gain at the end of the course?

You will gain knowledge about web  vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Command Injection, IDOR; knowledge about what purpose hackers use these methods for and gain the skills to identify these attack methods.
