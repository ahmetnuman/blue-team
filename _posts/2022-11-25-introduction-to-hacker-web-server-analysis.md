## Introduction to Hacked Web Server Analysis

When the internet is widely available in almost every home, web services have become a part of life and this has led to attackers targeting these services.

Attackers can steal information from web services for the purpose of making them nonfunctional, gaining fame, etc. They organize attacks on web servers to perform illegal activities. During the training, various attacks on web servers and analysis methods will be examined.

## Introduction to Log Analysis

Log recording is the recording of events that occur on the server. Thanks to the log records, undesired situations such as system errors and security risks can be analyzed.

In log analysis, it is of great importance that the analyst knows what he/she is looking for. Considering that there are all kinds of activity records in the log files, it will be very troublesome to reach the result without filtering.

Thus, it is crucial to pay attention to 3 steps during log analysis:

- Accessing the logs
- Determining the purpose for which log analysis will be carried out
- Extracting data by filtering log records for your intention

In the following sections, UNIX tools will be used while performing log analysis. If you are not familiar with these tools, we recommend that you should complete the "Linux for Blue Team" training first to get a better understanding.
