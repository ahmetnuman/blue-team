 ## Why Detecting Web Attacks Important

 When you look at the daily life of the Average Joe you will see that he uses many web applications throughout the day. There are those who visit Spotify to listen to music, those who visit YouTube to watch videos or those who use social media.

 It is no surprise that attackers choose web applications as a gateway for their attacks because all institutions have web applications which mostly contain critical data and because modern day applications are highly complicated and have numerous attack vectors. A study conducted by Acunetix reimburses this idea.

**Recent research shows that 75% of cyber attacks are done at the web application level**

 If we examine the anatomy of an attack, we see that the best scenario is to prevent the attack in its first phase. For this reason, there are various security precautions that aim to prevent and detect web applications (WAF, IPS, SIEM rulesâ€¦).

 It is crucial that a SOC analyst detects these web application based attacks which are the preference of attackers and takes precautions against them.
