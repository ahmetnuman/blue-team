## Basic Terminal Commands - 1

## What is the Command Line?

The command line is an intermediary program that receives commands from the user via the keyboard and transfers the commands to the operating system for execution. The command line in Linux is called "shell". There are many types of shells supported on Linux.

In this training, "bash" is used as the shell type and “Debian” is used as the Linux distribution.

When a command line window is opened on Debian, the following window pops:

## Command Line Structure

When the command line window is opened, we see a structure with a cursor waiting for a command from the user. This structure is as follows:

**username@hostname:current_directory$**

In this structure, the part before the "@" sign represents the username. The part from the "@" sign to the ":" sign represents the hostname. The part from the “:” to the “$” sign indicates which directory it is being worked on. The "$" sign on the far right is the last element in this structure. In the command line of the root user, who is the most authorized user in the system, the "#" sign is replaced by the "$" sign at the end of this structure.
